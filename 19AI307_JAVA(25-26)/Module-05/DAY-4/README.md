## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.	Read a thread name from the user using Scanner.
4.	Get the reference of the current running thread using Thread.currentThread().
5.	Change the name of the current thread to the user-provided name.
6.	Retrieve the current thread’s priority using getPriority().
7.	Print the thread’s priority, updated name, and full thread information.

        String threadName = sc.nextLine();

        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();

        currentThread.setName(threadName);

        int priority = currentThread.getPriority();

        System.out.println("Priority of Thread: " + priority);
        System.out.println("Name of Thread: " + currentThread.getName());
        System.out.println(currentThread);

        sc.close();
    }
}
